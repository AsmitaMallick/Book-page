              That Friday evening the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and brought rain first, and then sleet and snow. <br>My master kept to his  room; I sat in the lonely parlour with the moaning child laid on my knee; rocking it to and fro, when the door opened, and someone entered, out of breath.<br>'Excuse me!' answered a familiar voice, panting.<br> 'I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!Oh, I am aching all over! Don't be alarmed. Please order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.'<br>It was Mrs. Healthcliff, her hair streamed on her shouldrs, dripping with snow and water, a white face scratched and bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue. </h2></body></html>
